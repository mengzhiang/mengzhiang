{"name":"孟志昂的简历","tagline":"前端开发工程师","body":"# Jekyll-Bootstrap\r\n\r\nThe quickest way to start and publish your Jekyll powered blog. 100% compatible with GitHub pages\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFor all usage and documentation please see: <http://jekyllbootstrap.com>\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n0.3.0 - stable and versioned using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** 0.3.0 introduces a new theme which is not backwards compatible in the sense it won't _look_ like the old version.\r\nHowever, the actual API has not changed at all.\r\nYou might want to run 0.3.0 in a branch to make sure you are ok with the theme design changes.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n\r\nTo contribute to the framework please make sure to checkout your branch based on `jb-development`!!\r\nThis is very important as it allows me to accept your pull request without having to publish a public version release.\r\n\r\nSmall, atomic Features, bugs, etc.\r\nUse the `jb-development` branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted.\r\nPlease rebase as often as possible when working.\r\nWork on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.\r\n\r\nFor Big Features or major API extensions/edits:\r\nThis is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch.\r\nThis allows you to work in isolation but it means I'll have to manually merge your work into the next public release.\r\nTranslation : it might take a bit longer so please be patient! (but sincerely thank you).\r\n\r\n**Jekyll-Bootstrap Documentation Website.**\r\n\r\nThe documentation website at <http://jekyllbootstrap.com> is maintained at https://github.com/plusjade/jekyllbootstrap.com\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
